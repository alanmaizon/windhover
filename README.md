## ER Diagram:
The project can have three core tables:
- **Books**: 
  - `BookID`, `ISBN`, `Title`, `Author`, `Publisher`, `PublicationYear`, `ImagePath`, `Available`, `Deleted`
- **Members**: 
  - `MemberID`, `Name`, `Email`, `JoinDate`, `ProfilePicture`
- **BorrowingHistory**: 
  - `TransactionID`, `BookID` (foreign key), `MemberID` (foreign key), `BorrowDate`, `ReturnDate`
